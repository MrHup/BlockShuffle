## 🎮 Block Shuffle

Inspired by a classic puzzle game (which I had a physical copy of as a kid), **Block Shuffle** is the colorful modern take on it, powered by the minds of reddit. Compete with your fellow shufflers in beating tough levels or create them yourself for others to try, with Block Shuffle, you can enjoy a never ending stream of puzzles that are easy to learn, but hard to master!

## 🚀 What it Does

Block Shuffle lets players solve and create sliding block puzzles right in their Reddit feed. The game features:

- 🚗 Interactive sliding blocks of different sizes and colors;
- 🎯 Short & Goal-oriented gameplay with varying difficulty levels;
- 🏆 Competitive leaderboards for each puzzle;
- 🔨 Custom puzzle creation tools;
- 📊 Move tracking and solution sharing via Reddit comments!

## 🛠️ Technical Details

Built with:
- Devvit Custom Post Type;
- TypeScript/JavaScript;
- HTML5/CSS3;
- Redis for leaderboard storage.

## 🎯 Accomplishments

I am a "Pythonista" (as per reddit's documentation), so besides the obvious technical challenges, it was my first time finding out about the reddit apps and their capabilities. I am happy how everything turned out, and sad that I generated a puzzle I can't beat, even though I know it is possible!

## 🔮 What's Next for Block Shuffle

- 🎨 App uses _webview_, so next thing on the list is better mobile support - as of now, not all features I used are available on mobile;
- 🌟 Advanced puzzle validation system to avoid impossible puzzles being created;
- 🏆 Global ranking system; - something to make people return :)
- 🎲 Daily challenge puzzles.
